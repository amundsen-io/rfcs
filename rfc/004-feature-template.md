# <RFC title>

## Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the feature.
Create a new node type for neo4j which would represent Badges that is separate from the Tag node.

## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

In order to best use badges we want to add sentiment and category fields to the Badge nodes. This makes the Tag and Badge components different, as Badge requires more information now. Separating the two now will likely lead to less tech debt in the future when other features are implemented that impact the way we ingest and use badges.

## Guide-level Explanation (aka Product Details)

> Explain the proposal as if it was already included in Amundsen and you were teaching it to an Amundsen user. That generally means:

> Introducing new named concepts.
> Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
> Explaining how Amundsen users should think about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use Amundsen. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
> If applicable, provide deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
> For implementation-oriented RFCs, this section should focus on how maintainers should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy RFCs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.
- In the future this feature will hopefully replace all use of old Tag badges.

## UI/UX-level Explanation

> Explain the UI changes that your proposal would need (if applicable). This could mean:

> Provide a high level diagram or wireframe about the change.
> If applicable, suggest error, empty and loading states for the change.

## Reference-level Explanation (aka Technical Details)

> This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

> Its interaction with other features is clear.
> It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
> Corner cases are dissected by example.
> The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

The implementation will require:
- Add methods to the metadata service API to add, remove and, get badges as currently the service uses the methods for tags.
- Update badge ingestion docs to reflect new API call.
- Make updates to search, databuilder and frontend service to add functionality to use Badge instead of Tag.



## Drawbacks

> Why should we _not_ do this?

> Please consider:
> Implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
> Integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
> The impact on onboarding and learning about Amundsen
> Cost of migrating existing Amundsen installations (is it a breaking change?)
> If there are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.
- Takes more effort and time to implement than the alternative of keeping them together.

## Alternatives

> Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
> What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
> What is the impact of not doing this?
- Keep the current functionality and simply add two optional parameters fo sentiment and category to Tag.

## Prior art

> Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what this can include are:

> Does this feature exist in other data search applications and what experience have their community had?
> For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
> Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

> This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other projects, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture. If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other projects.

## Unresolved questions

> What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
> What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
> What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

## Future possibilities

> Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the project as a whole in a holistic way. Also consider how the this all fits into the roadmap for the project and of the relevant sub-team.
> This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.
> If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.
